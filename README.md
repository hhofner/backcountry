# Backcountry

Step into the skis of "Backcountry," your escape from standard PWA templates. Inspired by the unfettered thrill of backcountry skiing, Backcountry avoids the rigid build step, letting you carve your own path through the fresh, unexplored snow of application development. Packed with simple yet powerful modern tools, you'll navigate the steep drops and deep powder of PWA development, mirroring an exhilarating off-piste adventure. With Backcountry, you're not just coding; you're discovering the raw, breathtaking beauty of going out of bounds.
